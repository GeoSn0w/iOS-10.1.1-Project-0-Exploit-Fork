# iOS-10.1.1-Project-0-Exploit-For-Jailbreak---F.C.E.-365-Fork-
This is the Google's Project 0 exploits for iOS 10.1.1 modified a little bit. 
The exploits from Project 0 basically are for: Sansbox escaping and ROOT SHELL access, therefore, 90% of a jailbreak.
This project contains support for all x64 devices and I redesigned the white app page to tell the user he should be focusing on the Xcode Debug terminal not on the phone. Also there is a notification that the fork is not the original project.

So basically the main changes compared to the official Project 0 are:
*Compatibility with all arm64 devices
*Redesigned iOS app page (intead of white screen, it tells the user he should focus on the Xcode Debug Terminal).
*Better notifications when a known device is detected - Partially (still working on some devices).
 So instead of "found iphoen7,1" it will say "I detected an iPhone 6 that matched".
 
 This fork is more focused on user-friendly app and compatibilty.
